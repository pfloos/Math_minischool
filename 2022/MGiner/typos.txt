Eq. 3: the Hamiltonian should be square, right?
Ditto for Eq. 8.
page 5: "if their exists" -> "if there exists"
page 5: "commute" -> "commutes"
page 9: (G,B) -> (A,B)
page 9: "has an inverse" -> "have an inverse"
page 10: 4) mention that n is the size of the matrix
page 10: 7) is it SO(2)?
page 10: 8) why SO(3) non abelian?
page 14:Eq. 62 missing minus sign. Off-diagonal can be simplified to Cos[2\theta].
page 18: Eq. 87 replace S and T by B and F
